SYNOPSIS
            use Tk::CheckbuttonGroup;

            my($top) = MainWindow->new();
            my $selected = 'two';
            my $radiobuttongroup = $top->RadiobuttonGroup (
                    -list => [qw( one two three four five )],
                    -orientation => 'vertical',
                    -variable => \$selected,
                    -command => sub {
                            print @selected, "\n";
                    }
            );

WIDGET-SPECIFIC OPTIONS
    Name: list
    Class: List
    Switch: -list
        The names for the radiobuttons to be contained in this widget. If
        given as a list reference, the same value is used for the
        radiobutton's label and its value. If given as a hash reference, the
        keys are used as each radiobutton's label, and the values as their
        values. If given a list reference whose first element is a list
        reference, the sublist will be treated as a set of ordered key value
        pairs which is then treated as an ordered hash.

    Name: orientation
    Class: Orientation
    Switch: -orientation
        May be 'vertical' or 'horizontal'. Specifies how the radiobuttones
        are stacked.

    Name: variable
    Class: Variable
    Switch: -variable
        A reference to a scalar, whose value is that of the selected
        radiobutton, and is updated as the user interacts with the widget.
        This variable is not watched, and so state of the widget is only
        updated by changing the -variable option.

    Name: command
    Class: Command
    Switch: -command
        Specifies a perl/Tk callback to associate with all of the
        radiobuttons.

DESCRIPTION
    Displays a set of related radiobuttones with a frame in vertical or
    horizontal orientation.

    All radiobuttones are advertised with the names given in the -list
    option.

    Any additional options which are given to this widget are applied to all
    of the radiobuttons it manages.

BUGS
    The reference passed in the -variable option is not watched, and so the
    radiobuttons will not automatically update themselves if the scalar
    given in that reference changes.
